## Educational game

This project is for my final year project at UWE and it is my first attempt at game development. The game was developed using GoDot as the game engine. My goal was to develop an educational game aimed at teaching the basics of the environment and agriculture to a younger audience.
## Narrative
Taro, a cat-like creature with a longing for a meaningful connection to nature, has never felt at home in the busy, loud and dusty city. Taro, who is surrounded by pollution and concrete, imagines a life in which they can positively influence the environment and coexist peacefully with nature. Inspired by this dream, Taro saves every penny from their city job to buy a modest, old farm in the countryside that has the potential to become a natural paradise.

However, with nearly no money remaining and no prior farming expertise, Taro is intimidated by the work that lies ahead. However, Pip, an energetic and knowledgeable hamster who has lived close to the farm since birth, brings optimism. With her knowledge of rural life and farming methods, Pip is keen to assist Taro in improving the farm.
