# Digital Systems Project
## Educational game

This project is for my final year project at UWE and it is my first attempt at game development. The game was developed using GoDot as the game engine. My goal was to develop an educational game aimed at teaching the basics of the environment and agriculture to a younger audience.

## How to play the game

1. Download the SproutQuest.exe file
2. Use keyboard keys to move (a,w,s,d or the arrow keys)
3. Use 'I' key to open inventory
4. Use 'E' key to open the notebook (market, tasks)
5. Use the 'Esc' to open the menu
6. Use the scroll wheel or numbers to select an item in the hotbar
7. To use a tool or seeds - Left click
